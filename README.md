## AN IMPORTANT CHANGE
POLIX WILL SAY ITS OUT OF DATE SOON AS I AM MAKING THIS GITHUB NO LONGER PUBLIC IF YOU DONT UPDATE IN TIME YOU WILL HAVE TO DM ColRealPro#4927 FOR THE UNLISTED GITHUB LINK




## Please Read

This is my github for my product Polix Anti Cheat

Have fun reading my code

Please do not publish my assets as your own, Thank you

## How To Install

Go to the PolixDownloads folder in the github
I recommend you use the compiled builds (I rarely ever push out beta builds anyway)
Get the latest build by clicking it and then clicking Download

Go into the game you would like to install it to
Right click the workspace and select "Import from file"
Find wherever you downloaded polix to
Import it
Read the readme file inside of it :)

## Updates
Updates will happen sometimes if your version is out of date the server will print Polix is out of date

## You might want to know
Polix will be moving to serial keys soon, to prevent stealing. Polix will be loaded off of the cloud and it's source will be protected from regular users  (that don't own polix)
Anyone who does own polix will be able to see the source code but not know how to compile it, sorry just trying to prevent stealing
